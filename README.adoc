=== Common info

This service implements handlers for Telegram bot for easy stickers creation and other useful services to work with images.
The main platform for this service is Telegram, because it`s an easiest way to provide UI for interaction.
Maybe once there will be a webpage or API, but not in near future.

=== Features

==== Create sticker (/crt-sticker)

This feature has all steps to make a telegram sticker such as:

* Resize image to sticker size(at least one side should be exactly 512px);
* Add top and bottom text(in case of adding top text 15% top padding will be added as well);

Basically the result is something like this:

[cols="a,a", role="center"]
|===
| Source | Result

| image::example-sticker-before.png[width=250]
| image::example-sticker-after.png[]
